		<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
		
    <p>I’ve been interested in computers and information technology for as long as I can remember. 
		Right back from when I was 5 years old with my first console, the Nintendo Entertainment 
		System, I was hooked on tech. My family first got a 386 computer in the late 80s and my 
		focus shifted to the personal computer. Over the years I spent more and more time with 
		the computer, teaching myself the ins and outs of the DOS system, dabbling with some QBasic 
		and moving into the Windows platform. During this time my Mother also developed a strong 
		interest in Information Technology and eventually went on to becoming a technician and 
		became involved with running a local ISP in the latter half of the 90s, so as you might 
		imagine my interest also increased as I became more exposed to the world of IT in my own home. </p>
    <p>Once I left Secondary School I was accepted into a traineeship with a primary school on 
		the Sunshine Coast. During this traineeship I worked in tandem with the System Administrator 
		to maintain and upgrade the school network and information systems. I worked with the teachers, 
		teaching them how to use the local intranet as well as upgrading and maintaining computer 
		hardware. From there I went onto to do a Diploma in Information Technology and then into 
		working as a field technician for a business on the Sunshine Coast. </p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the business I was working for was sold and my position was made redundant, 
		at this time I was just starting a young family and took the first job I could, working as 
		a salesperson for a computer retailer. Over the last 12 years my interest in IT has remained,
		I've always tried to kept up to date with the lasest advancements in technology. I also love watching 
		tech reviews on YouTube and keeping my desktop PC up to date with the latest enthusiest hardware. </p>
		<p>Now, as my kids are older and I have a flexible workload in my job I’m ready to make a step towards a
		career change. Choosing RMIT was an easy decision, by studying through Open Universities I’m able to 
		continue to work full time while working on achieving my dream career. </p>
    <p>Over the years my focus in IT has shifted, while I was originally primarily interested in hardware 
		and networking, I’ve now decided to shift to more of a focus on software development. I’ve got a 
		couple friends working in this field that thoroughly enjoy it and are paid quite well for their 
		efforts. During the next few years as I undertake the Bachelor of Information Technology with 
		RMIT, I hope to refresh and update my knowledge on all things IT while honing in on the skills 
		I want to have a career in software development. </p>
