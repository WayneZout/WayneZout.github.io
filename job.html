    <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
    <p>At this point in time, as far as my ideal job would go, well I’m still really in the early stages. 
      For now, from all I’ve seen and experienced my ideal job would be working as the jack of all trades, 
      the Full Stack Developer.</p>
    <h2><u><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38522088?searchrequesttoken=ded47d61-0099-4030-87fd-4fb4c8094689&amp;type=standout">
      Senior FullStack .NET Developer</a></u></h2>
    <div class="maintext center"><img src=seekad.jpg class=image width="980" height="819" alt=""/></div>
    <p>This position is calling for a Full Stack Developer that specialises in the Microsoft stack, specifically 
      ASP.Net and its accompanying languages, to work with a team on the development of high quality web applications. 
      What I find appealing about this role is it requires a high level of skill and an ability to work within a team. 
      A full stack developer generally has the ability to take on an entire project using their skill set across the 
      whole range for a platform however I’ve always preferred the idea of working with a team, being able to share 
      ideas, split the workload and offer suggestions and improvements on a project. Of course, there is also the 
      $130k base salary, if you’re going to aim for something, you better aim high. </p>
    <p>The skills required to for this position cover a quite a large scope, as is the nature with a full stack developer. 
      You would need to be proficient in several coding languages, web platforms and applications to be successful, these 
      include ASP.NET, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, jQuery and Skeleton. </p>
    <p>For now my knowledge on such things is limited, in the past I helped with some ASP programming on a 
      couple projects with friends, as well as some experimentation with different programming languages but its early days. </p>
    <p>My plan to reach a role like this in an organisation will take place over the next 6 years. The first step being 
      to complete this Introduction to Information Technology and move onto a Bachelor of Information Technology. While 
      completing this Bachelor I plan to hone in on all programming and web development related electives. As my knowledge 
      increases, I hope to make my way into the industry as a low-level web developer, focusing on part of a project as I 
      further increase my skillset. I’d like to eventually work towards working on different parts of a project, learning 
      new things and expanding my knowledge in languages and platforms until ultimately, I can call myself a full stack 
      developer and work towards a job like the one advertised above.</p>
