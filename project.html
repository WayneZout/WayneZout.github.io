    <p><strong>Project</strong></p>
    <p>I work as an account manager / sales representative for a major appliance company in Australia. What I do in this role is visit retailers across Queensland, take photos of displays, maintain stock and report feedback to National Account Managers. My idea for a project is to customize an application that would allow multiple account managers across the country to correlate information, feedback and photos into one easy to access location. From here National Account Mangers would have access to the information gathered in the field, helping them to gage areas that need attention and pass feedback on to retailers during negotiations at a national level. </p>
    <p>The role of an account manager is a crucial to the wholesale industry, they are the foot soldiers of suppliers and the information they obtain is vital to the success of a business. Having worked in this industry for some time now and seeing the inefficiency in which information is gathered and shared between parties leads me to believe there is a huge market for an application that could streamline and enrich the way data is shared across different levels within an organisation. I’ve spoken with many account managers through different wholesalers that all share the same frustration when it comes to relaying and receiving information that is paramount to the day to day operation of their business. There is most certainly a better way to do this. </p>
    <p>First some background on the hierarchy of a wholesaler. </p>
	<div id="image"><p><img src=wholesale.jpg width="946" height="416" alt=""/></p></div>
    <p>From the top, we have the General Manager who oversees the whole operation, their role is to ensure revenue is expanding while maintaining optimal profit. This is done by coordinating with the National Account Managers. </p>
    <p>As there are several major retailers in an industry and no two retailers really works the same, it is most efficient to assign a National Account Manager to each. The role of the National Account Manager is to negotiate with buyers at respective retailers on the topics of buy in deals, sales and promotions, in store execution and training. They then pass this information onto the Account Managers in each state. From there they await feedback on each of points which they can then pass back onto the retailers, potentially influencing further business. </p>
    <p>The Account Managers are the foot soldiers, they enter the retail stores, interact with staff and managers and reinforce what was negotiated at a national level. Their role is monitor from a store level, ensure displays are at the negotiated standard, pricing is correct, managers are aware of offers and staff are fully trained. They then feed this information back up the chain. With that out of the way, we will move onto the nuts and bolts of the proposed application. </p>
    <p><strong>The “Wholesail” application</strong>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The idea behind this application is to create an environment that streamlines the process of communication within a wholesale business. This will be done using an interface similar to a social media application, however as a closed environment for a business. It will be designed to run on an iPad or android tablet as these are the main tools used in the field by all Account Managers. </p>
    <p><em>The General Feed</em>&nbsp;</p>
	<div id=image><p><img src=wholesailfeed.jpg width="500" height="888" alt=""/></p></div>
	<p>The general feed will be the landing page for the application. From here users will see a live feed of information and general social activity from their peers. It’ll enable all Account Managers to post updates on what they’re seeing out in the field. Share information they’ve gathered and post related pictures. </p>
    <p>It’ll also be used as a tool of inspiration and motivation, users will be encouraged to share experiences, highlight events and trade nights with images and generally pump each other up. It gets lonely on the road, this will bring the teams together and promote a higher level of team work and cooperation. </p>
