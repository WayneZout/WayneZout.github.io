    <h1>Project Idea</h1>

    <p>I work as an account manager / sales representative for a major appliance company in Australia. 
      What I do in this role is visit retailers across Queensland, take photos of displays, maintain stock 
      and report feedback to National Account Managers. My idea for a project is to customize an application 
      that would allow multiple account managers across the country to correlate information, feedback and photos 
      into one easy to access location. From here National Account Mangers would have access to the information 
      gathered in the field, helping them to gage areas that need attention and pass feedback on to retailers 
      during negotiations at a national level. </p>
    <p>The role of an account manager is a crucial to the wholesale industry, they are the foot soldiers 
      of suppliers and the information they obtain is vital to the success of a business. Having worked 
      in this industry for some time now and seeing the inefficiency in which information is gathered and 
      shared between parties leads me to believe there is a huge market for an application that could streamline 
      and enrich the way data is shared across different levels within an organisation. I’ve spoken with many 
      account managers through different wholesalers that all share the same frustration when it comes to relaying 
      and receiving information that is paramount to the day to day operation of their business. There is most certainly 
      a better way to do this. </p>
    <p>First some background on the hierarchy of a wholesaler. </p>
	<div class="maintext center"><img src=wholesale.jpg class=image width="946" height="416" alt=""/></div>
    <p>From the top, we have the General Manager who oversees the whole operation, their role is to ensure revenue 
      is expanding while maintaining optimal profit. This is done by coordinating with the National Account Managers. </p>
    <p>As there are several major retailers in an industry and no two retailers really works the same, it is most 
      efficient to assign a National Account Manager to each. The role of the National Account Manager is to negotiate 
      with buyers at respective retailers on the topics of buy in deals, sales and promotions, in store execution and 
      training. They then pass this information onto the Account Managers in each state. From there they await feedback 
      on each of points which they can then pass back onto the retailers, potentially influencing further business. </p>
    <p>The Account Managers are the foot soldiers, they enter the retail stores, interact with staff and managers and 
      reinforce what was negotiated at a national level. Their role is monitor from a store level, ensure displays are 
      at the negotiated standard, pricing is correct, managers are aware of offers and staff are fully trained. They then 
      feed this information back up the chain. With that out of the way, we will move onto the nuts and bolts of the proposed 
      application. </p>
    <h1>The “Wholesail” application</h1>
    <p>The idea behind this application is to create an environment that streamlines the process of communication within 
      a wholesale business. This will be done using an interface similar to a social media application, however as a closed 
      environment for a business. It will be designed to run on an iPad or android tablet as these are the main tools used 
      in the field by all Account Managers. </p>
    <p>The application itself will be split up in to five different sections, accessible by the bottom navigation bar.</p>

    <div class="maintext center"><img src=wholesailfeed.jpg class=image width="500" height="888" alt=""/></div>

    <h2>General Feed</h2>
	
	  <p>The general feed will be the landing page for the application. From here users will see a live feed of information 
      and general social activity from their peers. It’ll enable all Account Managers to post updates on what they’re seeing
       out in the field. Share information they’ve gathered and post related pictures. </p>
    <p>It’ll also be used as a tool of inspiration and motivation, users will be encouraged to share experiences, highlight 
      events and trade nights with images and generally pump each other up. It gets lonely on the road, this will bring the 
      teams together and promote a higher level of team work and cooperation. </p>
    <p></p>
    
    <h2>Company Information</h2>
    <p>The Company section of the application will be the communication channel to allow upper level management and human 
      resources to post valuable information. This might include changes to the terms and conditions of the social media 
      clause, company related media coverage or information on any upcoming company conferences. </p>
    
    <h2>Retail Groups</h2>
    <p>As each retail group operates in a different manner to the next, this section will allow users to look for information 
      on specific retailers. For example, a retail branch may be running a promotion on a range of products, therefor it is 
      important for an account manager to be aware of this before entering a store. Having an easy to access location on the 
      application will allow a national account manager to post vital information and of course make it easy for an account 
      manager to access to this before entering stores. 
        Having this information split into separate retailers on the app ensures account managers are only getting the information 
        they need, specific to the retailer they deal with.
      </p>

    <h2>State Groups</h2>
    <p>A section for each state will also be implemented as each state runs it’s own team of account managers. This will be the 
      section where account managers and national mangers can share information relative to a given state. This information may 
      include a message to say an account manager is off sick, can someone else cover their duties or perhaps a notification of 
      an upcoming trade event that all staff will be required to make a presence at.</p>
    
    <h2>Individual Stores</h2>
    <p>This section of the application will be one of the most important. From here each account manager will be able to tailor 
      information specific to each individual store they visit. </p>
    <p>It will include the ability to do the following.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Record the names of store managers and sales staff</li>
    <li>Store photos of merchandise displays and instore execution of sales promotions</li>
    <li>Record the ticket pricing on core models in store</li>
    <li>List any issues of concern</li>
    <li>List store specific trade agreements</li>
    </ul>
    <p>From this section the account manager will be able to walk into a store and update all the relevant information. From here 
      national account managers will be able to inspect the information, confirm tasks are being completed and using this information 
      when going back to negotiate deals with a retailer. If a buyer for a retailer wants to discuss a specific store, the information 
      will be at the fingertips of the national account manager.</p>
    
    <h2>Messaging</h2>
    <p>Finally, no application of this type would be complete with out a direct messaging system. Having this will enable all users to 
      directly message each other if something needs to be discussed that is not suitable to be on one of the main sections.</p>
